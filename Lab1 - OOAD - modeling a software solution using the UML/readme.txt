For this assignment, please follow the instructions in the attached Lab2.pdf document.

For Questions 1 and 3, you may create your drawings using any suitable drawing tool (e.g. Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Paint etc.) or you may download, install and use a UML diagramming tool (e.g. StarUML or Visio). However, to submit/upload your completed work, do not upload project files generated by the tool. Rather, simply take a JPG or PNG image of the diagram and add to a single document file (Word or PDF) for submission or submit the JPG or PNG file, by itself. e.g. Sample filename for upload/submission can be "JohnSmith-Lab2.doc" or "JaneDoe-Lab2.pdf" or JohnSmith-Lab2.JPG or JaneDoe-Lab2.PNG.

For Questions 2, compress/zip and submit only finished source code only. e.g. src.zip.

Be sure to write a short report describing how things went when you submit your work. e.g. State if you were able to complete all the given tasks; how long it took you; issues you encountered (if any) while working on the assignment etc.

Enjoy!
